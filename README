This was my first project on my way to become a Web Developer.
It was a challenge by Brian Hold in his course "Complete Intro to Web Development", available at frontendmasters.com.
It took me long hours to get this done, since I had no previous experience with JS (writting JS code was the real deal in this project). 
HTML wasn't a problem at all, but some little details in CSS also costed me some time.

The calculator can also be seen/used here (with code!):
